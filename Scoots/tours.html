            <h3>Counter-Clockwise around the Island</h3>
                <p>
                    With no stops it takes about 60 minutes to drive around the entire island, 
                    but we all know there are too many beautiful places not to stop! Plan on at least 4 hours but if 
                    you like to explore it will take more than one day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are so many places to to stop around the island to snorkel, buy drinks or food. 
                    Stretch your toes in the sand, try new foods, and splash in the ocean.
                </p>

            <h3>Drive the East side of the Island</h3>
                <p>
                    The east side of Cozumel is the most scenic and the ocean will always be in sight. 
                    There are beaches, restraunts, bars to stop at along the drive.
                </p>

            <h3>Drive to the southern tip of Cozumel</h3>
                <p>
                    At the souther tip of the island is Punta Sur, an eco beach park that you can pay an entrance fee to get in. 
                </p>

            <h3>Central Island</h3>
                <p>
                    Drive the road less traveled, away from the ocean and towards the Mayan Ruins. 
                </p>
