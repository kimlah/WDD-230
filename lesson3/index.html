        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                The Weather School Project is designed with elementary aged students in 
                mind. Elementary students will be able to navigate The Weather School 
                Project website with ease as they learn about weather in south-east Idaho, 
                more specifically the towns of Preston, Idaho, Soda Springs, Idaho, and Fish Haven, Idaho.
            </p>
            <p>
                Teacher's will have access to an easy to navigate website that allows 
                students the information needed to complete weather units in  elementary 
                school including a gallery of weather images in the specified three towns, 
                a storm center page that focuses on storms in the area and a home page
                with a current weather story with image along with current weather for 
                Preston, Soda Springs and Fish Haven.
            </p>
            <p>
                The site will have responsive design techniques that will allow students, 
                parents and teachers the ability to view the site well from any device. 
                This will make it easier to complete assignments on the go, at home or on
                any device available to the student.
